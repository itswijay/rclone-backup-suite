## Prerequisites

1. **Install `rclone`**
   ```bash
   curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```
2. **Set Up Cloud Storage**
   ```bash
   rclone config
   ```
   Follow the on-screen instructions to add Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.
3. **Install `mailutils` for Email Notifications** (Optional)
   ```bash
   sudo apt install mailutils -y  # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo yum install mailx -y      # CentOS/RHEL
   ```

## Installation

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itswijay/rclone-backup-suite.git
   cd rclone-backup-suite
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

   This will:

   - Install required dependencies (rclone, mailutils)
   - Make scripts executable
   - Create necessary directories
   - Configure rclone with your cloud storage
   - Update configuration files with your user paths

3. **Configure backup settings**
   Edit the `configs/backup.conf` file to customize your backup sources and destinations.

### Detailed Setup Guide

**New to this tool?** Check out our comprehensive **[Step-by-Step Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md)** that walks you through:

- Cloud storage configuration (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Backup and email settings
- Testing and verification
- Automated scheduling with cron
- Troubleshooting common issues

  ## Configuring Backup Settings

  Before running the backup, configure your settings in `configs/backup.conf`.

### **Example `backup.conf` (Backup Folders & Cloud Storage)**

```ini
# Backup source directories (local paths)
SOURCE_DIRS=(
  "/home/user/Documents"
  "/home/user/Pictures"
  "/home/user/Projects"
)

# Remote storage location (configured via rclone)
REMOTE_NAME="mygdrive"  # Name of rclone remote
REMOTE_PATH="Backups/rclone-backup-suite"

# Backup mode: "sync" (mirror) or "copy" (incremental)
BACKUP_MODE="sync"

# Retention settings (automatically delete log files older than 7 days)
RETENTION_DAYS=7
```

üìå **Explanation:**

- **`SOURCE_DIRS`** ‚Üí List of local directories to back up
- **`REMOTE_NAME`** ‚Üí Name of your cloud storage configured in `rclone config`
- **`REMOTE_PATH`** ‚Üí Remote directory to store backups
- **`BACKUP_MODE`** ‚Üí `"sync"` (mirror files) or `"copy"` (only add changes)
- **`RETENTION_DAYS`** ‚Üí Automatically delete log files older than specified days (keeps backup history clean)

### **Example `email.conf` (Email Notifications)**

```ini
# Basic email recipient
EMAIL_RECIPIENT="your-email@example.com"

# Email subject templates
EMAIL_SUBJECT_SUCCESS="Backup Success"
EMAIL_SUBJECT_FAILURE="Backup Failure"

# SMTP Configuration (NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED - Placeholders for future use)
# Currently, the backup script uses the system's default 'mail' command.
# To use email notifications, ensure 'mailutils' or 'mailx' is installed.
# Advanced SMTP support may be added in future versions.
SMTP_SERVER=""
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER=""
SMTP_PASS=""
```

üìå **Explanation:**

- **`EMAIL_RECIPIENT`** ‚Üí Where to send backup notifications
- **`EMAIL_SUBJECT_SUCCESS`** ‚Üí Custom subject line for successful backups
- **`EMAIL_SUBJECT_FAILURE`** ‚Üí Custom subject line for failed backups
- **`SMTP_*`** ‚Üí Placeholders for future SMTP implementation (currently not used)

**Note:** The script currently uses the system's built-in `mail` command. Make sure `mailutils` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `mailx` (CentOS/RHEL) is installed.

3. **Configure your settings**
   After running setup, customize your configuration:
   - Edit `configs/backup.conf` to set your source directories and remote settings
   - Edit `configs/email.conf` to set your email address for notifications
   - Test your setup with `./scripts/test_backup.sh`

## Usage

### **Test Backup (Recommended First)**

```bash
./scripts/test_backup.sh
```

This will run a test backup with confirmation prompts.

### **Run Backup Manually**

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

### **Restore Backup**

```bash
./scripts/restore.sh
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This will overwrite local files. Use with caution!

### **Automate Daily Backup (Crontab)**

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line to run backup daily at 11:30 PM (replace with your actual path):

```
30 23 * * * /full/path/to/rclone-backup-suite/scripts/backup.sh
```

## Email Notifications

Email notifications are sent automatically after each backup attempt with customizable subject lines.

To enable email alerts:

1. Configure `configs/email.conf` with your email address
2. Customize the email subject lines if desired (`EMAIL_SUBJECT_SUCCESS` and `EMAIL_SUBJECT_FAILURE`)
3. Ensure the system mail command is configured (uses `mailutils` or `mailx`)

**Note:** The script currently uses the system's default `mail` command. Advanced SMTP configuration is not yet implemented but is planned for future versions.

Test email setup:

```bash
echo "Test email" | mail -s "Backup Test" your-email@example.com
```

## Logs & Troubleshooting

- Logs are stored in the `logs/` folder with timestamps (e.g., `logs/backup_2024-07-04_14-30-25.log`)
- Each backup and restore operation creates a separate log file
- To check the most recent log:
  ```bash
  ls -t logs/ | head -1 | xargs -I {} tail -f logs/{}
  ```
- Common issues:
  - **"Remote not found"**: Run `rclone config` to set up your cloud storage
  - **"Source directory not found"**: Check paths in `configs/backup.conf`
  - **"Permission denied"**: Ensure scripts are executable with `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
